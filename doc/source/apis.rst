Accessing Android APIs
======================

When writing an Android application you may want to access the normal
Android APIs, which are available in Java. It is by calling these that
you would normally accomplish everything from vibration, to opening
other applications, to accessing sensor data.

These APIs can be accessed from Python to perform all of these tasks
and many more.
